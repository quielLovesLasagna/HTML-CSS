In hexadecimal (hex) numbering system, which is base-16, the numbers 0-9 represent their usual values, just like in our decimal (base-10) system. Here's what they represent:

- 0 represents zero.

- 1 represents one.

- 2 represents two.

- 3 represents three.

- 4 represents four.

- 5 represents five.

- 6 represents six.

- 7 represents seven.

- 8 represents eight.

- 9 represents nine.

Now, the letters A to F represent values beyond 9 in the hexadecimal system. Here's what each letter represents:

- A represents ten.

- B represents eleven.

- C represents twelve.

- D represents thirteen.

- E represents fourteen.

- F represents fifteen.

So, in a hex color code, when you see the letter "A," it represents ten, "B" represents eleven, and so on, up to "F" representing fifteen. This allows you to use a single character to represent values greater than nine, which is more compact and convenient for coding purposes.

For example:

#0F represents 15 in decimal.

#8B represents 139 in decimal (8 * 16 + 11).
