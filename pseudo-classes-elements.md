# CSS Pseudo classes vs CSS Pseudo elements

## CSS Pseudo-classes:
Pseudo-classes are used to select and style elements based on their state or position in the document structure. They are denoted by a single colon **(:)** and come after the selector.

Example:

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: #3498db;
  color: #fff;
}
```

In this example, the ```:hover``` pseudo-class is used to style a button when the user hovers over it.

## CSS Pseudo-elements:
Pseudo-elements, on the other hand, allow you to style specific parts of an element. They are denoted by a double colon **(::)** and also come after the selector.

Example:

```css
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #333;
}
```

In this example, ```::first-line``` is a pseudo-element used to style the first line of a paragraph.

#

### Key Differences:
1) Syntax:
- Pseudo-classes use a single colon, e.g., :hover.
- Pseudo-elements use a double colon, e.g., ::first-line.

2) Purpose:
- Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state or position.
- Pseudo-elements style specific parts of an element.

3) Examples:
- Pseudo-classes: :hover, :focus, :nth-child(odd).
- Pseudo-elements: ::before, ::after, ::first-line.

#

### Conclusion:
In summary, while pseudo-classes target elements based on their state, pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element. Both are powerful tools in CSS, and understanding when to use each will help you create more dynamic and visually appealing websites.
